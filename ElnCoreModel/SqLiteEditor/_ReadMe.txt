Note
----
The contents of this folder are meant for developers intending to modify the ELN Sqlite 
database structure.

The ELN Sqlite database was designed with the 'DbSchema' tool (https://dbschema.com/). 
The files in this folder relate to this application. However, any other SqLite tool 
alternatively can be used for modifying the database structure.

The EF Core Model then is built from the Sqlite database using the 'EF Core Power Tools'
extension for Visual Studio 2022 from ErikJ, using the 'Reverse Engineer' command.
