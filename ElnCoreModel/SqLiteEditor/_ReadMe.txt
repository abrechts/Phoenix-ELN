Note
----
The contents of this folder are meant for developers intending to modify the ELN Sqlite 
database structure.

The ELN Sqlite database was designed with the 'DbSchema' tool (https://dbschema.com/). 
The files in this folder relate to this application. However, any other SqLite tool 
alternatively can be used for modifying the database structure.

Note: For converting the SQLite database into the EFCore model, see the document 
'ScaffoldFromSqlite.txt' in the parent ElnCoreModel project root folder.
