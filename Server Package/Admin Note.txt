
Database Administrator Note
---------------------------

Run this script just once to set up the Phoenix ELN server database from scratch. No subsequent manual schema updates are required.

When updates to the server schema are required by future application releases, the first connecting client will auto-update the server schema automatically, and therefore does not require any server admin actions.
