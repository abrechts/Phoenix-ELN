# Phoenix ELN Help Documentation

## Introduction

This help documentation currently is work in progress. At this time it consists of a few quick tips, but is meant to grow in the future.

## Quick Tips

### Reaction Sketch

A typical _Phoenix ELN_ reaction sketch typically consists of _one_ single reactant and one or several products - the leftmost product being the reference product for reaction yield calculation. Additional products are considered side products. Please note that the reaction sketch is not meant for drawing _reagents_. When inserting a reference reactant or product into the experiment protocol, it already contains the molecular weight of its parent  sketch component.

Drawing _additional_ reactants is possible, e.g. for better illustration of an otherwise not obvious reaction. However, these must be entered as _reagents_ into the protocol, and their properties including molecular weight, must be entered by hand.

 >`Important` The reaction sketch is **not** meant for drawing all the _reagents_ utilized in the reaction. Instead, add them directly to the protocol using the addition toolbar located at its bottom.  


### Experiment Tree

_Phoenix ELN_ lets you organize your experiments into custom project folders. Once created within a specific project folder, an experiment can be moved to another project via a drag & drop operation. Just drop the dragged experiment onto the destination project title area until a drop rectangle around the project header and its contained experiments appears.
