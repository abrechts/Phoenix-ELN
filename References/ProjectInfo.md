## Materials Database

*Phoenix ELN* comes with a built-in collection of nearly 200 materials (reagents, solvents and auxiliaries) with cross-checked molecular weights and densities. This collection is automatically extended with additional materials and their proprties as you add them to the protocol.


## Chemical Drawing Editor

*Phoenix ELN* features an integrated chemical reaction drawing editor with following features (see [documentation](https://chembytes.com/helpdocs/ChemBytesDraw-2/DrawBonds.html)):
- Supports organic, salt, multi-component, organometallic, peptide, resin and polymer structures.
- Concise in-place context menus and intelligent next bond proposals prevent constant round-trips to application toolbars while drawing, resulting in a fluent drawing process.
- Another time-saver: Since the product structure usually is a variation of the reactant structure, the click of a button copies the reactant directly to the product side for subsequent partial modification to the required product structure.

## ELN Server Integration (optional)

*Phoenix ELN* runs fully self-sustained without any server connection. However, if you wish to take advantage of automatic in-house server synchronization of your data for continuous backup and experiment sharing across your organization, you may consider to install the *Phoenix ELN Server Package*. This package contains an installation script for a MySQL or MariaDB server database, along with detailed instructions, also for inexpensive NAS systems.
